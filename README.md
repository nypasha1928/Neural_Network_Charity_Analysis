# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
This project tried to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by the Alphabet Soup Co. Alphabet Soup Co. wants to provide funding to companies but it needs to know in advance whether it will be successful or not. Money is on the line here and we would not want for it to go to waste.

For this I will create a neural network by using Data Manipulation, creating training and testing sets, and finally analyzing my models that I have created.
